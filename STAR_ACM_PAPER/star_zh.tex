\begin{abstract}
Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging.
Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic questions, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query–table alignment.
We propose STAR (Semantic Table Aggregation and Representation), a lightweight framework that improves table representation through semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion.
STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects both representative and distinctive samples to construct a compact yet diverse partial table.
It then integrates table and synthetic question embeddings based on their semantic alignment, generating unified representations for more effective table retrieval.
This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness and interpretability of table representations.
Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on most datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive fusion for robust table representation.
